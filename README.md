<strong>Task Description: </strong>

Here's a test exercise where you should use only native JavaScript and JSON data:

Task:
Create a product catalog

Instructions:
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a JSON file containing an array of product objects, each with a name, price, description, and image URL.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Use JavaScript to retrieve the product data from the JSON file and display it on the page.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Each product should be displayed as a card, with the product image, name, price, and description.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    The user should be able to sort the products by price in ascending or descending order.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    The user should also be able to filter the products by price range.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    The cards should include an "Add to Cart" button, which should add the product to a shopping cart. The shopping cart should be stored in local storage and should persist even if the user refreshes the page.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    	The shopping cart should display the total number of items and the total cost.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    The user should be able to remove items from the cart.
  </li>
  
  <li>
    You should only use native JavaScript (no frameworks or libraries) to complete the task.
  </li>
</ol>

<strong>Note: </strong> The focus of the exercise is not on the design of the page, but rather on the use of JavaScript, JSON, and HTML/CSS to retrieve and display the product information and shopping cart functionality.
